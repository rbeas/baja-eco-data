# Welcome {#welcome}

This is a website to enchance the experience for analysis and collaboration in the Baja NSF CNH project. 

The goal of this website is for scientists, researchers, and collaborators to be aware of the analysis we are performing:


By doing this effort, the hope is that we will all have mastered strategies allowing us to use a freely-available and open-source toolsfor conducting research in a reproducible fashion.  The ideal we will be striving for is to be able to start from a raw data set and then write a computer program that conducts all the cleaning, manipulation, and analysis of the data, and presentation of the results, in an automated fashion.  Carrying out analysis and report-generation in this way carries a number of advantages to the researcher:

1. Newly-collected data can be integrated easily into our analysis.
2. If a mistake is found in one section of our analysis, it is not terribly onerous to correct it and then 
re-run all the downstream analyses.
3. Revising a manuscript to address referee comments can be done quickly.
4. Years after publication, the exact steps taken to analyze the data will still be available should anyone 
ask you how, exactly, you did an analysis!
5. If we have to conduct similar analyses and produce similar reports on a regular bias with new data each 
time, we might be able to do this readily by merely updating new data and then automatically producing the entire report.
6. If someone finds an error in our work, they can fix it and then easily show you exactly what they did 
to fix it.


Additionally, packaging one's research in a reproducible fashion is beneficial to the research community. 
Others that would like to confirm our results can do so
easily.  If someone has concerns about *exactly* how a particular analysis was carried out, they can find 
the precise details in the code that  we wrote to do it.
Someone wanting to apply your methods to their own data can easily do so, and, finally, if we are all 
transparent and open about the methods that we use, then
everyone can learn more quickly from their colleagues.


In many fields today, publication of research requires the submission of the original data to a 
publicly-available data repository.  Currently, several journals 
require that all analyses be packaged in a clear and transparent fashion for easy reproduction of the 
results, and I predict that trend will continue until most, 
if not all, journals will require that data analyses be available in easily reproduced formats. In the process, we will probably find that conducting our research in a reproducible 
fashion helps you work more efficiently (and perhaps even 
more enjoyably!)

This whole idea comes from [Eric Anderrson's rep-res-course](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/).

This is a book on the topic.  You 
can buy it, and you can also build and compile it yourself from the source code at its
[GitHub site](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book) with the 
tools you will learn in this course.

## About this website {#welcome-about-site}
Nearly all of the content for this website was authored using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).  
It was then rendered to html using 
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) wrapped in a [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) plugin written by Hadley 
Wickham.  The lecture notes appear in outline format and 
I had originally intended to also produce them in a presentation-friendly slide format.
rendered using the  `slidy_presentation` format of the `render` function from the `rmarkdown` package.
While that was easily possible, I found that it is perhaps better when presenting code-heavy
slides to just show the outline form in large format (the `bootstrap` CSS elements ensure that
the other navigation elements get out of the way!)
I build the site locally, and then 
push it up to [GitHub](http://github.com) where it is hosted for free. 

I point this out to stress that a single format---the easily-learned and easily-read Rmarkdown markup 
language (see what the raw source for this page looks like 
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eriqande/rep-res-course/master/index.rmd))---can be rendered to 
many different formats.  In fact, for demonstration,
here is a [PDF](./word_and_pdf/index.pdf) of this page automatically generated by converting Rmarkdown to 
LaTeX using [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
And, though I hope that you will have entirely weaned yourself from using Microsoft products for anything 
research-related by the time you are done with this 
course, it is worth knowing that you can render the same Rmarkdown source to [Word format](./word_and_pdf/index.docx).  For final submission of an article, 
converting to MS-Word format might be expedient if you don't know LaTeX.  (Though I have heard rumors that 
some journals may start accepting accepting markdown-formatted articles, eventually).  

All of which just goes to demonstrate what can be done with the techniques you will learn in this course: 
in addition to learning how to program and analyze data 
in R, and collaborate through GitHub, you will learn easy, reproducible, portable ways of disseminating 
your research results in multiple output formats from a 
single input format.

## Tools needed to contribute to this effort

1. to write programs in the [R](http://cran.r-project.org) language to manipulate and analyze data,
1. to integrate data analysis with report generation and article preparation using
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/),

1. to work fluently within the [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com) integrated development environment for R,
1. to use [git](http://git-scm.com) version control software and [GitHub](https://github.com) to effectively 
manage  source code, collaborate efficiently with 
other researchers, and neatly package their research.

## Links {#welcome-links}
You should be able to navigate quickly anywhere in the site using the navbar at the top of the page (Once 
that is completed!---It is getting
closer to being done!).  You can also find links here 
(eventually).  To the left you will find links to headings on whatever page you are on.
